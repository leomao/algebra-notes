\begin{definition}
  A polynomial $f(x) \in K[x]$ is said to be separable if its irreducible factors have no multiple roots in a splitting
  field $L$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
  There is a finite field $K$ with $\abs{K} = q \iff q = p^n$ for some prime $p$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$.
  In this situation, $K$ is unique up to isomorphism, denote by $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$.

  \begin{proof}
    ``$\Rightarrow$": Let $p = \Char K$ and $[K : \mathbb{Z}/ p\mathbb{Z}] = n$, then $\abs{K} = p^n$.

    ``$\Leftarrow$": Let $K$ be a splitting field for $f(x) = x^{p^n} - x$ over $\mathbb{F}_p$.
    We claim that the set of all roots of $f(x)$ forms a field. Since if $\alpha, \beta$ are
    two roots of $f$, obviously $\alpha \beta, \alpha \beta^{-1}$ are also roots,
    and by $(\alpha \pm \beta)^{p^n} = \alpha^{p^n} \pm \beta^{p^n} = \alpha \pm \beta$ because
    $\Char K = p$.
    $\alpha \pm \beta$ are also roots, hence the roots form a field. By definition, $K$
    is the smallest field containing $\mathbb{F}_p$ and roots of $f(x)$, so
    $K$ is exactly the set of roots of $f(x)$.

    Also, $f'(x) = -1$ has no root, so $f(x)$ has no multiple roots which implies $\abs{K} = p^n$.

    Moreover, if $K'$ is another finite field with $\abs{K'} = p^n$, then for all $\alpha \in K'$,
    $\alpha^{p^n} = \alpha$, so $\alpha$ is a root of $f(x)$, which implies that $K'$ is
    a splitting field for $f(x)$ over $\mathbb{F}_p$. By theorem ..., $k \cong K'$.
  \end{proof}
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
  Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{F}_q$ be a finite field. Then exists a unique extension
  $\Fb_{q^n} / \Fb_q$ satisfied $[\Fb_{q^n} : \Fb_q] = n$, and $\Aut \Big( \Fb_{q^n} / \Fb_q \Big) =
  \langle \sigma_q \rangle$ with $\sigma_q = \alpha :: \Fb_{q^n} \mapsto \alpha^q :: \Fb_{q^n}$.
  $\sigma_q$ is called the Frobenius homomorphism.

  \begin{proof}
    By theorem ..., $q = p^r$ for some prime $p$ and $r \in \Nb$, so $q^n = p^{nr}$ which is a power of
    a prime. Again by theorem ..., $\Fb_{q^n}$ is the splitting field for $x^{p^{nr}} - x$ over $\Fb_p$.

    Since $x^q - x \mid x^{q^n} - x$, $\Fb_q \subseteq \Fb_{q^n}$ and thus $[\Fb_{q^n}: \Fb_{q}] = n$. 
  \end{proof}
\end{theorem}

\begin{lemma}
  Every irreducible polynomial in $\Fb_{p^n}[x]$ is separable.

  \begin{proof}
    Since $\sigma_p$ is an isomorphism, $\Fb_{p^n} = \Fb_{p^n}^p = \{ \alpha^p \mid \alpha in \Fb_{p^n}\}$.
    Assume $f(x)$ has a multiple root $\alpha$.
  \end{proof}
\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem}
  $x^{p^n} - x$ equals the product of all monic irreducible polynomials in $\Fb_p[x]$ of degree $d$ where
  $d$ runs through all divisors of $n$.
\end{theorem}
